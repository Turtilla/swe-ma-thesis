# ma-thesis-swe

### IDEAS
+ [Transcribed memoirs of Juliusz Czermi≈Ñski](https://github.com/Turtilla/ma-thesis-swe/blob/main/Polish/Memoirs.docx), late 19th century (un/self-educated); [incomplete historical corpus](https://spxvi.edu.pl/korpus/), [modern corpus](http://nkjp.pl/index.php?page=14&lang=0)
+ Topics relating to Shakespeare's English or Early Modern English, related to [my other MA thesis](https://github.com/Turtilla/ma-thesis-swe/blob/main/English/MA_thesis_ver_1.pdf) (but a lot has already been done on that topic); I tried finding my way around [historical corpora](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/index.html) but a lot of links seem to be outdated.
+ Some AA(V)E related topics (maybe comparative with other American English?); [corpus/corpora](https://oraal.uoregon.edu/about); [Independent Studies project](https://github.com/Turtilla/ma-thesis-swe/blob/main/English/INDEPENDENT%20STUDIES%20II%20-%20AAVE.pdf)
+ language variation/change in social media - gaming (MMO)-related terms, differences between different MMO communities (from [r/elderscrollsonline/](https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/) and [r/wow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/))
+ [the topics that were already suggested](https://sites.google.com/view/sasha-berdicevskis/home/masters-projects?pli=1)

### SKILLS/KNOWLEDGE
+ Historical linguistics, cognitive linguistics, some sociolinguistics, some comparative linguistics.
+ Python (recently also Discord bots - but is that ethical/legal for data scraping? Unsure, but this is why I haven't suggested anything involving that).
+ English, Polish, some Swedish, a bit less German.
