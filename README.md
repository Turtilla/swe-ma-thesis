# ma-thesis-swe

### IDEAS
+ (in the Polish folder) - transcribed memoirs of Juliusz Czermi≈Ñski, late 19th century (un/self-educated); (incomplete historical corpus https://spxvi.edu.pl/korpus/, modern corpus http://nkjp.pl/index.php?page=14&lang=0)
+ (in the English folder) - topics relating to Shakespeare's English or Early Modern English, related to my other MA thesis (but a lot has already been addressed there); I tried finding my way around historical corpora but a lot of links seem to be outdated https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/index.html
+ https://oraal.uoregon.edu/about - some AA(V)E related topics (maybe comparative with other American English?)
+ language variation/change in social media - gaming (MMO)-related terms, differences between different MMO communities (from r/elderscrollsonline/ and r/wow/)
+ the topics that were already suggested

### SKILLS/KNOWLEDGE
+ Historical linguistics, cognitive linguistics, some sociolinguistics, some comparative linguistics.
+ Python (recently also Discord bots - but is that ethical/legal for data scraping? Highly unsure).
+ English, Polish, some Swedish, a bit less German.
